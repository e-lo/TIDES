Optionally, you will likely find it easier to use GitHub Desktop , an IDE instead of a simple text editor like VSCode , Eclipse , Sublime Text , etc. Fork the repository into your own GitHub account and clone it locally . Create a branch to work on a new issue (or checkout an existing one where the issue is being worked on). Install pre-commit so you can check your code and text formatting. [Optional] Install act to run github actions locally. Issues \u00b6 Create issues to start discussion on a new topic. If the issue is associated with a pull request, be sure to link the two. There are shortcuts here Pull Requests \u00b6 Use the following guidance in creating and responding to pull requests Keep pull requests small and focused. One issue is best. Link Pull Requests to Issues as appropriate. Complete the pull request template as best you can. Commits \u00b6 Use the following guidance for commits Provide a short, clear title. Capitalize.

Project Governance \u00b6 Ahead of Version 1.0 release, the governance for the TIDES specification is being kept limited and lightweight. The governance approach will be revisited as release of Version 1.0 approaches. Development of the TIDES specification shall be managed by the following groups: Leadership Product Management Team Registered Contributors All Other Stakeholders These groups will have the following rights and responsibilities: Leadership \u00b6 Leadership is responsible for overall direction and decision-making on the project including: approval of registered contributors creation, scoping, and management of working groups approval of the final specification for Version 1.0 approval of changes to project governance Leadership Group Members John Levin, Metro Transit (Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN) Leadership Group Member GitHub Access : Admin Product Management Team (PMT) \u00b6 The Product Management Team (PMT) is responsible for creating and maintaining backbone standards infrastructure, processes, and resources to support the development of the TIDES specification. The PMT will support Leadership in developing, reviewing, and recommending for approval changes to the draft specification. The PMT will support Contributors and Stakeholders in their work on the specification.

They propose additions, modifications, and improvements to the speciation document through issues and pull requests in this GitHub repository. Contributors must request here to be registered in order to gain access. Requests to become a Contributor must be approved by project Leadership. Contributor Group Members: The list of registered contributors is maintained in the #contributors file. Contributor Group GitHub Access : Write Stakeholders \u00b6 Stakeholders will be informed about progress on TIDES and given the opportunity to review the specification as it is developed. They may provide comments on the specification by creating or responding to Issues in this repository. Stakeholders are not able to generate or comment on pull requests. To be included as a TIDES Stakeholder, join the TIDES Project Google Group. Stakeholder Group Membership: Members of the TIDES Project Google Group Others who have expressed interest in following progress or contributing to TIDES, but who have not requested to be a registered Contributor Stakeholder Group GitHub Access : Read/Create Issues (same as general public) Review and Approval Process \u00b6 Prior to release of Version 1.0 of the specification, the PMT and Leadership will have final approval of all changes. All Contributors are permitted and encouraged to discuss and comment on issues and pull requests and make recommendations for changes to the specification.

Code of Conduct \u00b6 Contributors to the TIDES Project are expected to read and follow the Code of Conduct for the project in the #CODE_OF_CONDUCT file. Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct \u00b6 Our Pledge \u00b6 We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our Standards \u00b6 Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Examples of unacceptable behavior include: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others\u2019 private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Enforcement Responsibilities \u00b6 The community leaders for this effort include project Leadership and the Product Management Team as described in the Project Governance section of #CONTRIBUTING . Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. Scope \u00b6 This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement \u00b6 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at tidestransit@gmail.com . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Enforcement Guidelines \u00b6 Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct: 1. Correction \u00b6 Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning \u00b6 Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban \u00b6 Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. 4. Permanent Ban \u00b6 Community Impact : Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Consequence : A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
